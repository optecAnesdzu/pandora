- One option is to use [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), a free online repository of preprints and e-prints in physics, mathematics, computer science, and related fields. You can search for keywords such as "advanced solid state physics" or "theoretical solid state physics" and filter by categories such as "condensed matter physics" or "strongly correlated electrons". You can also browse by authors, dates, or subjects. Once you find a paper that interests you, you can download it as a PDF by clicking on the "PDF" link on the right side of the page.
- Another option is to use [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/), a platform that provides access to academic books and journals published by Cambridge University Press. You can search for keywords such as "advanced solid state physics" or "solid state physics" and filter by content type, subject, date, or language. You can also browse by collections, series, or authors. Some of the books and journals are open access, which means you can download them as PDFs for free by clicking on the "PDF" link on the left side of the page. For example, you can download the second edition of *Advanced Solid State Physics* by Philip Phillips for free from this [link](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/advanced-solid-state-physics/4A95C82854C0AA277D785E4D47699511).
- A third option is to use [Google Books](https://books.google.com/), a service that allows you to search and preview millions of books from libraries and publishers worldwide. You can search for keywords such as "advanced solid state physics" or "solid state physics" and filter by language, date, or relevance. You can also browse by categories, subjects, or authors. Some of the books are fully viewable online, which means you can download them as PDFs for free by clicking on the "Download PDF" link on the top right corner of the page. For example, you can download *Advanced Solid State Physics* by Philip Phillips for free from this [link](https://books.google.com/books/about/Advanced_Solid_State_Physics.html?id=5n02cBeJSj0C).

These are some of the ways to download advanced solid state physics PDFs for free online. However, please note that not all of the books and papers are legally or ethically available for free. Some of them may be protected by copyright or require a subscription or a purchase. Therefore, before downloading any PDFs, please make sure that you respect the rights and wishes of the authors and publishers.
